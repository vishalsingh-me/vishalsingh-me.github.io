# From front-end craft to AI engineering

I have spent years making interfaces feel calm and clear. That mindset is useful while I learn AI engineering because many AI features fail due to messy UX, not just weak models.

## The bridge

- Good prompts and data still need predictable UI flows
- Validation, fallbacks, and guardrails mirror front-end patterns
- Clear feedback reduces user anxiety when AI is uncertain

Here is a simple loop I use when planning an AI powered feature:

```text
[User goal] -> [Input check] -> [AI call] -> [Fallback if low confidence]
                       |                  -> [Explain output]
                       -> [Log for tuning]
```

## Practical steps I follow

- Start with a manual version in the UI before wiring models, so we know the desired shape of the answer.
- Keep prompts and model settings visible in the codebase; small changes can ripple across the UX.
- Add empty state copy that respects the user's time instead of hiding behind spinners.

The front-end lessons carry over: design for clarity, measure latency, and give people confidence that the system is acting responsibly.
